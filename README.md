## 🔴 Netflix Logo Drawer 📺

A simple Python program that uses the turtle graphics library to draw the stylized Netflix 'N' logo . This project serves as a basic demonstration of using the turtle library for creating graphical outputs, showcasing how to combine precise coordinate movements, set headings, and use filled shapes to create a recognizable corporate logo.

## 🚀 Key Features

Draws Netflix 'N': Creates the iconic 'N' logo using three connected, filled rectangles (two vertical, one slanted).

Color Scheme: Uses the characteristic red fill on a black screen for a high-contrast visual match.

Modular Drawing: The drawing logic is encapsulated in functions (Teleport, draw_N_lines, draw_Middle_Line) for clear, structured code.

Simple and Standalone: The program is self-contained and requires no external dependencies beyond the standard turtle library.
